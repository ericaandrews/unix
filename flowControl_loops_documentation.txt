-Unix/Linux Bash Shell Scripting
-Write a bash shell script which does the following:
  -Uses a simple if statement to test for existence of a file:
      
      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ if [ -e Desktop/Untitled.txt ]
      > then
      > echo "Untitled.txt file exists"
      > else
      > echo "Untitled.txt file does not exists"
      > fi
      Untitled.txt file exists
      
   -If the file exists display the file size and name:
      (you can get the file size using the ls or stat commands -- man stat; man ls;)
      
      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ ls Desktop

      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ stat Desktop
      16777220 615608 drwx------ 15 ericaandrews staff 0 510 "Jul 17 13:51:37 2018" 
      "Jul 17 13:51:22 2018" "Jul 17 13:51:22 2018" "Jul  8 15:33:09 2015" 4096 0 0 Desktop

  -Use an if/then/else statement to check if a particular directory exists:
  -If it does exist, then output a friendly message indicating the directory exists: 
      
      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ if [ -d Desktop ]
      > then
      > echo "Desktop does exists"
      > else
      > echo "Desktop does not exists"
      > fi
      Desktop does exists
      
  -If it doesn't exist, then create the directory:
      
      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ if [ -d Untitled ]
      > then
      > echo "Desktop does exists"
      > else
      > echo "Desktop does not exists"
      > fi
      Desktop does not exists
      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ mkdir Untitled
      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ if [ -d Untitled ]
      > then
      > echo "Desktop does exists"
      > else
      > echo "Desktop does not exists"
      > fi
      Desktop does exists
  
  -Use an if/elif statement to test input from the user:
  (use the read command to capture the input)
  -Output something useful for each condition:
    -Test for the following values:
      -number < 10, number between 50 and 100, number > 500
        and then anything else: 
      
      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ echo -n "Enter a number > "
      Enter a number > Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ read character
      501
      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ if [ "$character" > "500" ]; then
      > echo "You entered a number greater than five hundred."
      > elif [ "$character" >= "50" && "$character" <= "100" ]; then
      > echo "You entered a number greater than or equal to 50 and less than or equal to 100."
      > elif [ "$character" < "10" ]; then
      > echo "You entered a number less than 10."
      > else
      > echo "The number entered applies to one or more of the following conditions: "
      > echo "Greater than or equal to 10"
      > echo "Greater than 100"
      > echo "Less than 50"
      > echo "Less than or equal to 500"
      > echo "Not a number"
      > fi
      You entered a number greater than five hundred.

-Use a switch statement to implement the same conditions as the if/elif above

      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ echo -n "Enter a number > "
      Enter a number > Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ read character
      101
      Ericas-MacBook-Air:~ ericaandrews$ case $character in
      > 1 ) echo "You entered a number greater than five hundred."
      >     ;;
      > 2 ) echo "You entered a number greater than or equal to fifty and less than or equal to one hundred."
      >     ;;
      > 3 ) echo "You entered a number less than ten."
      >     ;;
      > * ) echo "The number entered applies to one or more of the following conditions: "
      >     echo "Greater than or equal to ten"
      >     echo "Greater than one hundred"
      >     echo "Less than fifty"
      >     echo "Less than or equal to five hundred"
      >     echo "Not a number"
      > esac
      The number entered applies to one or more of the following conditions: 
      Greater than or equal to ten
      Greater than one hundred
      Less than fifty
      Less than or equal to five hundred
      Not a number
