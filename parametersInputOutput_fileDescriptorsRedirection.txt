Part I
The first script should take input from the user using the "read" command.
  -Create a command line option "-d" which, if given, will allow the user 
    to store the "dirs.txt" file in a directory. This file, and the directory, should be created 
    before creating the command line option. 
    
    $ > dirs.txt
    $ mkdir directory
    $ while read -p "Enter the name of the directory to store the dirs.txt file: " name
      > do
      >  if [ -d $name ]; then
      >  mv dirs.txt $name
      >  break
      > fi
      > done
    Enter the name of the directory to store the dirs.txt file: directory
    $ ls directory
    dirs.txt
    
  -Create a command line option "-f" which, if given, will allow the user to change the name of 
    the "file.txt" file. This file, and a file with the new name, should be created 
    before creating the command line option. 
  
    $ > file.txt
    $ > newfilename.txt
    $ while read -p "Enter the new name of the file.txt file: " name
      > do
      >  if [ -f $name ]; then
      >  mv file.txt $name
      >  break
      > fi
      > done
    Enter the new name of the file.txt file: newfilename.txt
    $ ls newfilename.txt
      newfilename.txt
    $ ls file.txt
      ls: file.txt: No such file or directory
